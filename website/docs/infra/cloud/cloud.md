# Cloud infra

Modern cloud infrastructure leverages managed services across multiple layers to achieve scalability, security, and operational efficiency. At the foundation, organizations establish **secure networking (VPC + VPN)** with centralized **access management** and **DNS routing**, while containerized applications run on **managed Kubernetes** services with automatic scaling and **load balancing**. Data managed through dedicated **storage services** and encrypted **secret management** systems.
